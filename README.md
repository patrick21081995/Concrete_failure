# Concrete defects

Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network, the VGG16 (Reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) (Keras API: https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/) model was established in relation to images of concrete with defects (e.g. cracks, points of discontinuity) that can occur in faults and images of concrete without surface flaws.

## Results

The results demonstrated, using a database with 30001 training images and 9501 validation images, with 500 test images, an accuracy of 99.40%.

## Database

The database can be downloaded via the link https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DL0321EN/data/concrete_data_week4.zip to be used in any computational models, for free use.
